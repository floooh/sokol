    sokol_fontstash.h -- renderer for https://github.com/memononen/fontstash
                         on top of sokol_gl.h

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_FONTSTASH_IMPL

    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    The following defines are used by the implementation to select the
    platform-specific embedded shader code (these are the same defines as
    used by sokol_gfx.h and sokol_app.h):

    SOKOL_GLCORE
    SOKOL_GLES3
    SOKOL_D3D11
    SOKOL_METAL

    ...optionally provide the following macros to override defaults:

    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_FONTSTASH_API_DECL    - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_FONTSTASH_API_DECL
    SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)
    SOKOL_UNREACHABLE() - a guard macro for unreachable code (default: assert(false))

    Include the following headers before including sokol_fontstash.h:

        sokol_gfx.h

    Additionally include the following headers for including the sokol_fontstash.h
    implementation:

        sokol_gl.h

    HOW TO
    ======
    --- First initialize sokol-gfx and sokol-gl as usual:

            sg_setup(&(sg_desc){...});
            sgl_setup(&(sgl_desc){...});

    --- Create at least one fontstash context with sfons_create() (this replaces
        glfonsCreate() from fontstash.h's example GL renderer:

            FONScontext* ctx = sfons_create(&(sfons_desc_t){
                .width = atlas_width,
                .height = atlas_height,
            });

        Each FONScontext manages one font atlas texture which can hold rasterized
        glyphs for multiple fonts.

    --- From here on, use fontstash.h's functions "as usual" to add TTF
        font data and draw text. Note that (just like with sokol-gl), text
        rendering can happen anywhere in the frame, not only inside
        a sokol-gfx rendering pass.

    --- You can use the helper function

            uint32_t sfons_rgba(uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b, uint8_t a)

        To convert a 0..255 RGBA color into a packed uint32_t color value
        expected by fontstash.h.

    --- Once per frame before calling sgl_draw(), call:

            sfons_flush(FONScontext* ctx)

        ...this will update the dynamic sokol-gfx texture with the latest font
        atlas content.

    --- To actually render the text (and any other sokol-gl draw commands),
        call sgl_draw() inside a sokol-gfx frame.

    --- NOTE that you can mix fontstash.h calls with sokol-gl calls to mix
        text rendering with sokol-gl rendering. You can also use
        sokol-gl's matrix stack to position fontstash.h text in 3D.

    --- finally on application shutdown, call:

            sfons_destroy(FONScontext* ctx)

        before sgl_shutdown() and sg_shutdown()


    WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THE HOOD:
    ============================

    FONScontext* sfons_create(const sfons_desc_t* desc)
        - creates a sokol-gfx shader compatible with sokol-gl
        - creates an sgl_pipeline object with alpha-blending using
          this shader
        - creates a 1-byte-per-pixel font atlas texture via sokol-gfx
          (pixel format SG_PIXELFORMAT_R8)

    fonsDrawText():
        - this will call the following sequence of sokol-gl functions:

            sgl_enable_texture();
            sgl_texture(...);
            sgl_push_pipeline();
            sgl_load_pipeline(...);
            sgl_begin_triangles();
            for each vertex:
                sgl_v2f_t2f_c1i(...);
            sgl_end();
            sgl_pop_pipeline();
            sgl_disable_texture();

        - note that sokol-gl will merge several sgl_*_begin/sgl_end pairs
          into a single draw call if no relevant state has changed, typically
          all calls to fonsDrawText() will be merged into a single draw call
          as long as all calls use the same FONScontext

    sfons_flush(FONScontext* ctx):
        - this will call sg_update_image() on the font atlas texture
          if fontstash.h has added any rasterized glyphs since the last
          frame

    sfons_destroy(FONScontext* ctx):
        - destroy the font atlas texture, sgl_pipeline and sg_shader objects


    MEMORY ALLOCATION OVERRIDE
    ==========================
    You can override the memory allocation functions at initialization time
    like this:

        void* my_alloc(size_t size, void* user_data) {
            return malloc(size);
        }

        void my_free(void* ptr, void* user_data) {
            free(ptr);
        }

        ...
        FONScontext* fons_context = sfons_create(&(sfons_desc_t){
            ...
            .allocator = {
                .alloc_fn = my_alloc,
                .free_fn = my_free,
                .user_data = ...,
            }
        });
        ...

    If no overrides are provided, malloc and free will be used. Please
    note that this doesn't affect any memory allocation performed
    in fontstash.h (unfortunately those are hardwired to malloc/free).
