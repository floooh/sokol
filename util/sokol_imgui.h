    sokol_imgui.h -- drop-in Dear ImGui renderer/event-handler for sokol_gfx.h

    Project URL: https://github.com/floooh/sokol

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL or
        #define SOKOL_IMGUI_IMPL

    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the
    implementation.

    NOTE that the implementation can be compiled either as C++ or as C.
    When compiled as C++, sokol_imgui.h will directly call into the
    Dear ImGui C++ API. When compiled as C, sokol_imgui.h will call
    cimgui.h functions instead.

    NOTE that the formerly separate header sokol_cimgui.h has been
    merged into sokol_imgui.h

    The following defines are used by the implementation to select the
    platform-specific embedded shader code (these are the same defines as
    used by sokol_gfx.h and sokol_app.h):

    SOKOL_GLCORE33
    SOKOL_GLES2
    SOKOL_GLES3
    SOKOL_D3D11
    SOKOL_METAL
    SOKOL_WGPU

    Optionally provide the following configuration defines before including the
    implementation:

    SOKOL_IMGUI_NO_SOKOL_APP    - don't depend on sokol_app.h (see below for details)

    Optionally provide the following macros before including the implementation
    to override defaults:

    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_MALLOC(s)     - your own malloc function (default: malloc(s))
    SOKOL_FREE(p)       - your own free function (default: free(p))
    SOKOL_IMGUI_API_DECL- public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_DECL      - same as SOKOL_IMGUI_API_DECL
    SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)

    If sokol_imgui.h is compiled as a DLL, define the following before
    including the declaration or implementation:

    SOKOL_DLL

    On Windows, SOKOL_DLL will define SOKOL_IMGUI_API_DECL as __declspec(dllexport)
    or __declspec(dllimport) as needed.

    Include the following headers before sokol_imgui.h (both before including
    the declaration and implementation):

        sokol_gfx.h
        sokol_app.h     (except SOKOL_IMGUI_NO_SOKOL_APP)

    Additionally, include the following headers before including the
    implementation:

    If the implementation is compiled as C++:
        imgui.h

    If the implementation is compiled as C:
        cimgui.h


    FEATURE OVERVIEW:
    =================
    sokol_imgui.h implements the initialization, rendering and event-handling
    code for Dear ImGui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) on top of
    sokol_gfx.h and (optionally) sokol_app.h.

    The sokol_app.h dependency is optional and used for input event handling.
    If you only use sokol_gfx.h but not sokol_app.h in your application,
    define SOKOL_IMGUI_NO_SOKOL_APP before including the implementation
    of sokol_imgui.h, this will remove any dependency to sokol_app.h, but
    you must feed input events into Dear ImGui yourself.

    sokol_imgui.h is not thread-safe, all calls must be made from the
    same thread where sokol_gfx.h is running.

    HOWTO:
    ======

    --- To initialize sokol-imgui, call:

        simgui_setup(const simgui_desc_t* desc)

        This will initialize Dear ImGui and create sokol-gfx resources
        (two buffers for vertices and indices, a font texture and a pipeline-
        state-object).

        Use the following simgui_desc_t members to configure behaviour:

            int max_vertices
                The maximum number of vertices used for UI rendering, default is 65536.
                sokol-imgui will use this to compute the size of the vertex-
                and index-buffers allocated via sokol_gfx.h

            sg_pixel_format color_format
                The color pixel format of the render pass where the UI
                will be rendered. The default is SG_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8

            sg_pixel_format depth_format
                The depth-buffer pixel format of the render pass where
                the UI will be rendered. The default is SG_PIXELFORMAT_DEPTHSTENCIL.

            int sample_count
                The MSAA sample-count of the render pass where the UI
                will be rendered. The default is 1.

            const char* ini_filename
                Sets this path as ImGui::GetIO().IniFilename where ImGui will store
                and load UI persistency data. By default this is 0, so that Dear ImGui
                will not preserve state between sessions (and also won't do
                any filesystem calls). Also see the ImGui functions:
                    - LoadIniSettingsFromMemory()
                    - SaveIniSettingsFromMemory()
                These functions give you explicit control over loading and saving
                UI state while using your own filesystem wrapper functions (in this
                case keep simgui_desc.ini_filename zero)

            bool no_default_font
                Set this to true if you don't want to use ImGui's default
                font. In this case you need to initialize the font
                yourself after simgui_setup() is called.

    --- At the start of a frame, call:

        simgui_new_frame(&(simgui_frame_desc_t){.width = ..., .height = ..., .delta_time = ..., .dpi_scale = ...});

        'width' and 'height' are the dimensions of the rendering surface,
        passed to ImGui::GetIO().DisplaySize.

        'delta_time' is the frame duration passed to ImGui::GetIO().DeltaTime.

        'dpi_scale' is the current DPI scale factor, if this is left zero-initialized,
        1.0f will be used instead. Typical values for dpi_scale are >= 1.0f.

        For example, if you're using sokol_app.h and render to the default framebuffer:

        simgui_new_frame(&(simgui_frame_desc_t){
            .width = sapp_width(),
            .height = sapp_height(),
            .delta_time = sapp_frame_duration(),
            .dpi_scale = sapp_dpi_scale()
        });

    --- at the end of the frame, before the sg_end_pass() where you
        want to render the UI, call:

        simgui_render()

        This will first call ImGui::Render(), and then render ImGui's draw list
        through sokol_gfx.h

    --- if you're using sokol_app.h, from inside the sokol_app.h event callback,
        call:

        bool simgui_handle_event(const sapp_event* ev);

        The return value is the value of ImGui::GetIO().WantCaptureKeyboard,
        if this is true, you might want to skip keyboard input handling
        in your own event handler.

    --- finally, on application shutdown, call

        simgui_shutdown()
